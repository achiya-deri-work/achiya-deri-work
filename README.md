Hello 👋 i'm achiya deri.
Im 16 years old right now and living 🏠 in isreal.
The thing i most consider myself knowing is philosophy.
I also like weightlifting 🏋️‍♀️ even though i suck at it. 
My music is definitely rock 🎸, especially 90's rock, and even more 90's grunge (Imagine it's nirvana's logo).

Even though i would like to think i'm pretty decent with that.
My pride is Python after that i know some basic C.

In Python i know some ML-AI-algorithmics stuff which i learn mostly for the fun and math.

In C i didn't really dived in to deep i only know the basics and i built a pacman 2D game.

Feel free to contact me 👋.
