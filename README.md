Greetings! 👋 I'm Achiya Deri, a 19-year-old currently residing in Israel 🏠. I have a strong affinity for philosophy and a passion for weightlifting 🏋️‍♀️, even though I'm still working on mastering the art.

When it comes to music, you'll find me jamming out to rock 🎸, with a special place in my heart for 90's rock and the iconic grunge scene (envision Nirvana's logo).

My programming pride lies in Python, and I've also dipped my toes into the realm of basic C programming.

In the Python realm, I've delved into ML, AI, and algorithmic concepts, driven mainly by my enthusiasm for their mathematical underpinnings.

Feel free to reach out and connect 👋.
